# alx-airbnb-project-documentation

Welcome to the documentation repository for the **Airbnb Clone Backend** project. 

This project is documentation-focused and outlines the backend architecture, use cases, data models, user flows, and requirement specifications essential for developing the backend system.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this documentation is to:

* Clearly define **core backend functionalities**
* Map **system workflows** using diagrams (Use Case, Flowchart, DFD)
* Translate system interactions into **User Stories**
* Write **technical requirements** for API development and backend logic

This helps lay the groundwork for actual development and ensures alignment between business needs and technical execution.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Features and Functionalities

A complete overview of the backend features, such as:

* User Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
* Property Management (CRUD for listings)
* Booking System (date validation, status tracking)
* Payments (Stripe/PayPal integration)
* Admin Dashboard, Notifications, Reviews, etc.

📎 See: [`features-and-functionalities/features-and-functionalities.png`](./features-and-functionalities/feature-flowchart.png)


### 2. Use Case Diagram

Visual representation of user-system interactions, including:

* Register/Login
* List or Search Properties
* Book, Pay, and Review listings

📎 See: [`use-case-diagram/use-case-diagram.png`](./use-case-diagram/use-case-diagram.png)

### 3. User Stories

Functional user stories from multiple user perspectives:

* Guests: search, book, and review properties
* Hosts: list, edit, and manage bookings
* Admins: oversee all users and activities

📎 See: [`user-stories/user-stories.md`](./user-stories/user-stories.md)

### 4. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Shows how data moves between modules:

* Inputs → Processes → Storage → Outputs
* Covers Users, Bookings, Payments, Listings

📎 See: [`data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png`](./data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png)


### 5. System Flowchart

Detailed workflow for **Property Booking**, including:

* Searching, selecting, validating, and confirming a booking
* Payment and notification integrations

📎 See: [`flowcharts/A_flowchart_in_the_image_illustrates_the_property_.png`](./flowcharts/data-flow-diagram.png)

### 6. Requirements Specifications

Technical specs for backend features with:

* API Endpoints & Methods
* Input/Output schemas
* Validation Rules
* Performance expectations

📎 See: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
